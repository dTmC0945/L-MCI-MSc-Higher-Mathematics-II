** Lecture Information

The goal of this lecture is to improve what has been taught at  [[https://github.com/dTmC0945/L-MCI-MSc-Higher-Mathematics-I][M.Sc Higher Mathematics I]]
and start working on engineering problem where there are more than one variable. The
lecture will focus on mathematical concepts which will have direct usage with real life
engineering applications.

The Lecture structure for this lecture is as follows.
