** Lecture Information

- The goal of this lecture is to improve what has been taught at  [[https://github.com/dTmC0945/L-MCI-MSc-Higher-Mathematics-I][M.Sc Higher Mathematics I]]
  and start working on engineering problem where there are more than one variable. 
- The lecture will focus on mathematical concepts which will have direct usage with real life
  engineering applications.

The structure for this lecture is as follows.
